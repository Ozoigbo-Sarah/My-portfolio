    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m Sarah Ozoigbo, a passionate front-end developer based in Nigeria. I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology at the Federal University of Technology, Minna. Though my initial goal was to study engineering, I was offered IT instead — and what seemed like a diversion turned out to be a blessing in disguise.
    </p>

    <p>
      My journey into tech began in 2023 when I enrolled in a comprehensive Full-Stack Web Development course by Angela Yu on Udemy — a gift from my brother that changed my life. What started out as confusion about my career path slowly transformed into clarity and excitement as I discovered my passion for building things with code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the past year, I’ve dedicated myself to learning and practicing front-end development, mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring designs to life in clean, responsive websites. Now, I’m preparing to transition into the back-end phase of full-stack development, eager to understand how everything works behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a student and a developer, I believe growth comes from consistency and curiosity. My journey hasn’t always been smooth, but the motivation to keep learning and the excitement I feel when I build something new keeps me going. I’m committed to improving my skills, exploring new technologies, and becoming a well-rounded full-stack developer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m currently open to opportunities, collaborations, and internships where I can contribute, learn, and grow. If you're looking for someone who is driven, enthusiastic, and eager to solve problems with code, I’d love to connect.
    </p>
